Features:

Allows users to choose a nickname upon connection.
Sends and receives messages from the chatroom server.
Utilizes threading for concurrent execution of sending and receiving messages.
Instructions:

Run the script.
Choose a nickname when prompted.
Start chatting with other users in the chatroom.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
The script utilizes the socket and threading modules, which are included in Python's standard library.

TCP Chatroom Server

This Python script acts as a TCP server for a chatroom. It listens for incoming connections from clients and facilitates real-time communication among connected users.

Features:

Listens for incoming connections on a specified port.
Accepts multiple clients and assigns nicknames.
Broadcasts messages to all connected clients.
Handles client disconnections gracefully.
Instructions:

Run the script.
Clients can connect to the server using the server's IP address and port.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
The script utilizes the socket and threading modules, which are included in Python's standard library.
Usage:

bash
Copy code
python chatroom_server.py
Note:

Ensure that the client and server scripts are run on the same network.
Clients should connect to the server using the server's IP address and the specified port.
This chatroom implementation is a basic example and may require additional features for production use, such as authentication, encryption, and error handling.
